I've been writing software for love and/or money since my first Minecraft mod in 2013. 

### Quick language facts:
- Rust, Python, TypeScript, and JavaScript are the languages I have at least a year of professional experience in. They are also the languages I am most skilled in, in that order.  
- The language I'm actively learning is C#. The next language I want to learn is Go.  
- The experimental language that has currently piqued my interest is Vine (previously it was Gleam). The language I would most like to know better is Haskell.  

### Quick professionally relevant facts:
- The most interesting courses of my degree were on compiler design (Java), multimedia coding (C), functional programming (Haskell), theoretical computer science & computational complexity (`\LaTeX` :) ), and graph theory (also `\LaTeX`).  
- Usually at work I write backend applications with tight latency, correctness, and performance requirements. I encourage my coworkers to adopt static analysis, CI/CD, and proper testing.
- I'm currently employed as a software engineer writing and maintaining Node.js applications and a Google Cloud + Kubernetes environment.
- Besides the above, I've built non-trivial projects in Java and React.js.

### Highlighted projects:
- properly RFC-compliant, albeit barebones [SMTP relay](https://github.com/mademast/sail) (Rust)
- overconfident [hangman bot](https://github.com/novedevo/lose_at_hangman_rs) (Rust)
- [raytraced 3D renderer](https://github.com/novedevo/raytracer) (Rust)
- aquifer tracking [webapp](https://github.com/novedevo/watertable) (Python, HTML/CSS/JS)

### Additional technologies
- DevOps: Google Kubernetes Engine, CircleCI, CloudFlare {Pages, Workers, DNS, KV}
- Competent (min. one university course) in Haskell, C, C++, x86_64 ASM (AT&T syntax), VHDL, and MATLAB.
  - Most of these courses I have in repositories here, some are private due to the professors' request.
- Adobe CC, Office, Agile, etc...
