# Hi! I'm Devon.

## About Me
I'm a mostly self-taught 2nd year computer engineering student at SFU. I love Python, Rust, and web development. I'm currently working as a junior software developer managing Google Cloud.

## Currently learning:
- Rust (RFC-compliant [SMTP relay](https://github.com/gennyble/sail); snarkily overconfident [hangman AI](https://github.com/novedevo/lose_at_hangman_rs), and a [raytraced 3D renderer](https://github.com/novedevo/raytracer))
- Python (Aquifer tracking and visualization in this [notebook](https://github.com/novedevo/watertable); simple [Discord bot](https://github.com/novedevo/starboard))
- Web development (visible on [my website](https://nove.dev))
- Functional programming + category theory + Haskell
- NodeJS; working on a REST server

## Prior experience in
- Java ([Rush Hour](https://github.com/novedevo/rush-hour))
- C++ ([IoT pet feeder](https://github/com/novedevo/ENSC100W-project))
- MATLAB (Various class projects, locked on professor's request)
- VHDL ([Tensor core](https://github.com/novedevo/ENSC-252))
- Adobe InDesign (Various projects)
- ...and more!
