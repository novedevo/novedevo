# Hi! I'm Devon.

## About Me
I'm a mostly self-taught 2nd year computer engineering student at SFU. I love Python, Rust, and web development.

## Currently hacking on:
- Rust! I love the language, although I'm still a bit of a zoea, so my carcinization is incomplete. Working on a [WASM project](https://github.com/novedevo/lose_at_hangman_rs), soon to be on my website.
- HTML/CSS/JS (visible on [my website](https://nove.dev))
- Python (Jupyter) [notebook](https://github.com/novedevo/vaccine-predictor) using numpy, matplotlib, etc to forecast the vaccination timeline.

## Currently learning:
- Functional programming (interested in working with Haskell)
- Rust
- Python (always)
- React.js

## Prior experience in
- C++
- MATLAB
- VHDL
