# Hi! I'm Devon.

## About Me
I'm a mostly self-taught 2nd year computer engineering student at SFU. I love Python, web development, and open-source software.

## Currently hacking on:
- Rust! I love the language, although I've just started learning it. Working on a WASM project, soon to be on my website.
- HTML/CSS/JS (visible on [my website](https://nove.dev))
- Phaser.js (visible on the [phaser section of my website](https://nove.dev/phaser))

## Currently learning:
- Data structures and algorithms in Java (university class, private code for academic honesty reasons)
- Python (always)
- React.js (in progress)

## Prior experience in
- C++
- MATLAB
- VHDL
