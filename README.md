# Hi! I'm Devon.

## About Me
I'm a mostly self-taught 4th year computer science student at SFU. I have professional experience in Python, Rust, and JavaScript. I'm currently working as a contract software developer writing Rust and Node applications in a Google Cloud + Kubernetes environment.

## Highlights:
- Rust (RFC-compliant [SMTP relay](https://github.com/mademast/sail); snarkily overconfident [hangman AI](https://github.com/novedevo/lose_at_hangman_rs), and a [raytraced 3D renderer](https://github.com/novedevo/raytracer))
- Python (aquifer tracking in this [website](https://github.com/novedevo/watertable))
- Node, React, JS, TS (work)

## Additional technologies
- DevOps: Google Kubernetes engine, CircleCI deployments
- Web development (Node and React professionally, also visible on [my website](https://nove.dev))
- Competent in Haskell, Java, C, C++, x86_64 assembly, VHDL, and MATLAB
- Familiar with Adobe Creative Cloud: InDesign, Audition, Premiere Pro
- ...and more!
