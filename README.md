# Hi! I'm Devon.

## About Me
I'm a mostly self-taught 3rd year computer science student at SFU. I love Python, Rust, and JavaScript. I'm currently working as a contract software developer writing Rust and Node applications in a Google Cloud + Kubernetes environment.

## Highlights:
- Rust (work, RFC-compliant [SMTP relay](https://github.com/mademast/sail); snarkily overconfident [hangman AI](https://github.com/novedevo/lose_at_hangman_rs), and a [raytraced 3D renderer](https://github.com/novedevo/raytracer))
- Python (work, also aquifer tracking in this [notebook and website](https://github.com/novedevo/watertable))
- Node, React, JS, TS (work)

## Additional technologies
- Kubernetes & other DevOps such as CircleCI (work)
- Web development (work, also visible on [my website](https://nove.dev))
- Java, C++, MATLAB, VHDL
- Adobe InDesign (Various projects)
- ...and more!
