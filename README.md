# Hi! I'm Devon.

## About Me
I'm an autodidact with a computer science degree. I have professional experience in Rust, Python, and TypeScript. I'm currently working as a software developer writing (asynchronous, adversarial, low-latency, resilient) Rust and Node applications and deploying them to a Google Cloud + Kubernetes environment.

## Highlights:
- Rust (actually RFC-compliant [SMTP relay](https://github.com/mademast/sail); snarkily overconfident [hangman bot](https://github.com/novedevo/lose_at_hangman_rs), and a [raytraced 3D renderer](https://github.com/novedevo/raytracer))
- Python (aquifer tracking in this [website](https://github.com/novedevo/watertable))
- Node, React, JS, TS (work)

## Additional technologies
- DevOps: Google Kubernetes Engine, CircleCI, CloudFlare (Pages, Workers, DNS, KV)
- Web development (Node and React professionally, also visible on [my website](https://nove.dev))
- Competent in Haskell, Java, C, C++, x86_64 assembly, VHDL, and MATLAB
- Familiar with Adobe Creative Cloud: InDesign, Audition, Premiere Pro
- The most interesting courses of my degree were on compiler design, multimedia coding, functional programming, theoretical computer science and computational complexity, and graph theory.
